# ryr1
Ryanodine Receptor is a Ca+2 channel involved in skeletal muscle excitation and contraction.

Here, we are calculating the energy landscapes using MCCE. Calculations are done on two datasets.  One with the RyR1 macromolecules in equilibrium with a thermal bath without any activating ligands and the other in equilibrium with both a thermal bath and a reservoir of ligands, specifically calcium, ATP, and caffeine. This pooling of data allows both species to be described in terms of the same set of mutually orthogonal conformational coordinates.

## ligand_binding_sites:
These PDB files were prepared by Danya Ben Hail.  There are 50 files labeled frame_01 to frame_50.  In this dataset the structure is changed to give us only the residues that are near the binding site.
