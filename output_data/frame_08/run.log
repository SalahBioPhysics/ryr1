Last Updates:                                              
   04/10, Added Pascal Comte's GA/SA algorithm for sidechain
          packing and sampling.     			      
   04/10, Added APBS electrostatic calculation option      
   08/08, Total pairwise is set to be 999.0 if vdw is 999.0
   08/02, step 3, zero interaction bug fixed               
   07/23, step 1 changes the policy on AltLoc backbone atoms
          now it is warning instead of fatal error.        
   06/22, step 1 recognizes FME and ACE as NTR caps        
   05/27, step 2 reduces rotation steps for surface residues
          The run.prm.default uses 0.25 SAS to decide suface
          residues.                                        
   05/04, Program doesn't stop at duplicate parameters,    
          it issues a warning message. This fixes the deadlock
          caused by multiple new cofactors                 
   04/24, Energy lookup table compressed, size is reduced  
          to about 1/12                                    
   04/24, Opp files are compressed. Temporary files are    
          stored under local directory.                    
   04/14, Step 2 rotamer pruning by pairwise corrected.    
   04/08, Step 2 repacking now ses better H bnd correction.
   01/26, Step 3 fixed incorrect errno message.            
   01/14, Step 3 dielectric boundary condition improved.   
   12/07, Step 3 dielectric boundary condition is corrected.
   11/17, pKa fitting writes "pKa titration curve too sharp"
          when occ jumps from 0.015 to 0.985.              
   11/17, Exposed conformer is marked as E in history.     
   11/02, Optional quick step 3 included.                  
   11/02, Pruning fuction is added at the end of step 2.   
          Parameter lines were added to run.prm.           
   10/29, Temporary gdbm files have file names.            
   10/11, Use biggest rxn energy from the last 3 delphi    
          focusing runs.

Last Updates:                                              
   04/10, Added Pascal Comte's GA/SA algorithm for sidechain
          packing and sampling.     			      
   04/10, Added APBS electrostatic calculation option      
   08/08, Total pairwise is set to be 999.0 if vdw is 999.0
   08/02, step 3, zero interaction bug fixed               
   07/23, step 1 changes the policy on AltLoc backbone atoms
          now it is warning instead of fatal error.        
   06/22, step 1 recognizes FME and ACE as NTR caps        
   05/27, step 2 reduces rotation steps for surface residues
          The run.prm.default uses 0.25 SAS to decide suface
          residues.                                        
   05/04, Program doesn't stop at duplicate parameters,    
          it issues a warning message. This fixes the deadlock
          caused by multiple new cofactors                 
   04/24, Energy lookup table compressed, size is reduced  
          to about 1/12                                    
   04/24, Opp files are compressed. Temporary files are    
          stored under local directory.                    
   04/14, Step 2 rotamer pruning by pairwise corrected.    
   04/08, Step 2 repacking now ses better H bnd correction.
   01/26, Step 3 fixed incorrect errno message.            
   01/14, Step 3 dielectric boundary condition improved.   
   12/07, Step 3 dielectric boundary condition is corrected.
   11/17, pKa fitting writes "pKa titration curve too sharp"
          when occ jumps from 0.015 to 0.985.              
   11/17, Exposed conformer is marked as E in history.     
   11/02, Optional quick step 3 included.                  
   11/02, Pruning fuction is added at the end of step 2.   
          Parameter lines were added to run.prm.
